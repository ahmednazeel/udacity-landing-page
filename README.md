# Landing Page Project

This is my first project, and I hope to succeed in using the tools I have learned to implement what is required of me in this project and I am very excited to complete the course.

I have added the sections with JavaScript.

I created a function to create a link for each section.

The header disappears when reading any text and appears when scrolling

Modified the active class properties for both section and link.

I made an element  (a) tag to go to the top of the page.
